### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

In 2011, I started to study at the database programming department in Bursa and got acquainted with the software. I am a software developer who loves to research and learn and is passionate about games and technology. In 2015, I started to study at Uludag University Computer Programming Department. During my education at UludaÄŸ University, I worked as an assistant in 2 different companies and universities for a certain period of time. As a result of working in different fields, I went to Mersin University Business Information Management department in 2017 in order to improve myself and create versatile software. Here, I tried to improve myself by taking different courses from business management to product marketing. With these idioms, I continued to develop software to make people's lives easier. Currently, I continue to work by developing mobile and web software so that people can organize and manage their daily lives more easily.
