### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

In 2011, I started studying in the database program department in Bursa and got acquainted with the software. I am a software developer who loves to research and learn, is passionate about games and technology, and develops in new technologies. I studied at Uludag University Computer Programming Department. While I was studying at Uludag University, I improved myself by gaining different business experiences in different companies. I am currently studying at Mersin University, Department of Business Information Management. By developing projects, I am trying to help people with software production so that they can organize their daily life and manage them more easily.
